              <h2 class="text-center">Ben Nye</h2>
              <p>Born in beautiful Fairbanks, Alaska (the golden heart of the interior), Ben grew up playing in the snow, reading books, and daydreaming about fantastical worlds. His parents instilled in him a curiosity about the way the world works, a love of quiet and the outdoors, and a strong independant streak.</p>
              <p>After highschool, his interest in education took the lead and he moved across the country to the 'burbs of Philadelphia to attend Swarthmore College where he majored in computer science. He spent the next decade embroiled in a series of pursuits: statisical modeling of particle simulations, a masters degree from Penn, and machine learning research for predicting exchange rates.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Just after returning to Philly for his masters, Lizzy's world intersected with his for the first time. As their list of mutual friends grew (by way of playing more ultimate frisbee), they continued to be involved in an increasing number of social events - parties, outings, activies. Unfortunately, they never ended up spending all that much time in more intimate settings... until Ben decided to move to Boston to pursue a PhD.</p>
              <p>In the last two months of his stint in Philly, Ben finally managed to connect with Lizzy in closer settings that gave him a chance to get to know just how warm, loving, playful, entertaining, intelligent, and overall awesome she is. It turns out that girls aren't always scary, and at the risk of letting the oportunity of a lifetime pass him by, Ben finally asked Lizzy on a date just after moving 360 miles away.
              </p>
              <p>Better late than never!</p>

              <p>Well, you can probably guess a bit about her childhood. She was always the gregarious, adventurous one. While Ben spent his time daydreaming, Amy was off making friends and finding new experiences. Never one to conform to what everyone else was doing, Amy went off to Evergreen College in Washington state where she studied ecology, botany, and biology. She found herself spending summers doing research on the north slope of Alaska while battling ravenous flocks of mosquitos, and spending her free time exploring Alaska's riverways.</p>
              <p>She managed to find a partner who shared her love of boating and exploration, and as a bonus they fell madly in love. Amy married her husband in 2013, and just welcomed her second child in to the world in January. Don't think for a second that she's slowed down - we're pretty sure her kids are going to be part river otter.</p>

            <p>Mount Cardigan rises up out of the Shem Valley as a beacon for outdoor lovers. Hikers are drawn to its bare summit not only for views but also for the quiet forests that line its approach. Look for salamanders, mushrooms, and blueberries along the way. Waterfalls, a small pond for swimming, and a nature trail await.</p>
            <p><img src="img/tmp/leaves.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>
            <p>Next to Mount Cardigan State Forest, Cardigan Lodge is located on a 1,200-acre reservation owned by AMC and features a peaceful, roads-end location. Explore 50 miles of trails, or simply relax on our deck or by the fireplace.</p>

            <p>Due to the limitations of the area, all of the available guest lodging has already been booked. Please let us know what your preferences are, and we will do our best to match you up with a room that will best suit your needs.</p>
            <div class="text-center"><h3>Cardigan Lodge</h3></div>
            <p>For those so inclined, the top two floors of the lodge are all hostel-style rooms with sleeping room for up to 62 guests. In addition the bunk rooms, there are several campgrounds surrounding the lodge.</p>
            <p><img src="img/tmp/rooms2.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>
            <div class="text-center"><h3>Local B&amp;Bs</h3></div>
            <p>For those who'd prefer a more removed respite, there are two nearby B&amp;Bs: <a href="http://www.thewhipplehouse.com/" style="color: #F9DA78;">The Whipple House</a>, and <a href="http://www.pleasantviewbandb.net/" style="color: #F9DA78;">The Pleasant View</a>. They are each ~20 mins driving from the lodge where all of the ceremonies and festivities will be taking place.

            <h2 class="text-center">Travel</h2>

	          <p>All festivities for the weekend will take place on location at Cardigan Lodge. Although making it to the lodge takes some effort, once you arrive you're free to put your feet up (or boots on the trail) and enjoy the area of the course of the event.</p>
          	<div class="text-center"><h3>Getting There</h3></div>

Alternatively, the main <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NaCzb7EtFVC2" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Boston airport</a> is still only a two hour drive.</p>
            <p>We are currently considering creating a schedule so that interested parties can coordinate to share a car rental if interested. Details forthcoming!</p>
          	<div class="text-center"><h3>Things To Do</h3></div>
          	<p>Hiking around the lodge. Cardigan Lodge's primary purpose is to serve as an access point to an awesome network of trails. Bring some hiking shoes and don't miss out!</p>
            <p><img src="img/tmp/hiking.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>
            <p>Sport climbing at Rumney Rocks. 45 minutes from the location is one of New Englands most popular sport climbing spots. The general store in Rumney also has awesome icecream.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.funspotnh.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Largest Arcand in the World</a>. Who knows - it sounds wacky.</p>
            <p>Pop in to the neighboring town of Bristol, NH (home of the legendary Whipple House B&amp;B). There's a little <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/shacketts-brewing-company-bristol" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">brewery</a>, places to eat, and more.</p>
