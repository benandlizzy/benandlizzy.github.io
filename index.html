              <h2 class="text-center">Ben Nye</h2>
              <p>Born in beautiful Fairbanks, Alaska (the golden heart of the interior), Ben grew up playing in the snow, reading books, and daydreaming about fantastical worlds. His parents instilled in him a curiosity about the way the world works, a love of quiet and the outdoors, and a strong independent streak.
 
              <p>After high school, his interest in education took the lead and he moved across the country to the 'burbs of Philadelphia to attend Swarthmore College where he majored in computer science. He spent the next decade embroiled in a series of pursuits: statistical modeling of particle simulations, a master’s degree from Penn, and machine learning research for predicting exchange rates.
 
              <p>Just after returning to Philly for his master’s degree, Lizzy's world intersected with his for the first time when they joined the same ultimate frisbee team. As their list of mutual friends grew (by way of playing more ultimate frisbee), they continued to be involved in an increasing number of social events - parties, outings, activities. Unfortunately, they never ended up spending all that much time in more intimate settings... until Ben decided to move to Boston to pursue a Ph.D.
 
              <p>In the last two months of his stint in Philly, Ben finally managed to connect with Lizzy in closer settings that gave him a chance to get to know just how warm, loving, playful, entertaining, intelligent, and overall awesome she is. It turns out that girls aren't always scary, and at the risk of letting the opportunity of a lifetime pass him by, Ben finally asked Lizzy on a date just after moving 360 miles away.

              <p>Better late than never...</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Lizzy Wagoner</h2>

              <p>Lizzy is from Brookfield, Illinois, a Chicago suburb and home of the world’s greatest zoo. She grew up spending most of her time dancing at her mother’s studio. When she graduated from high school, she moved to Indianapolis to attend Butler University with her twin. There she majored in dance, Spanish, and chemistry (a very useful combination), studied abroad in Chile, and ran on the university’s track team. At the end of her four-year tenure, she decided to focus her studies on chemistry and began a Ph.D. program at Indiana University.</p>
 
              <p>After becoming Dr. Wagoner, she accepted a position with ExxonMobil and moved to Philadelphia with her two dogs. In a new place with a new job, she decided to meet new people by trying a new hobby. She met Ben playing ultimate frisbee and found him to be a very cute, smart, and entertaining fella. All of her flirting and hangout invitations seemed to go about eight feet over his head, but over the course of four years and many Twister duels they developed a good friendship.</p>
               
              <p>Then, one day out of the blue, Ben took the leap and asked Lizzy out on a date. Unfortunately, he had moved to Boston and dating was no longer easy.  Their first date was a three-day backpacking trip along the Appalachian Trail and Ben brought a 2 lb bag of Hershey’s kisses and a 3 lb block of cheese.</p>
               
              <p>A little over a year of alternating weekends between Philadelphia and Boston, Lizzy moved to Beantown. On the way from Philadelphia to Boston, Ben took a detour to show her his alma mater. While walking through the forest preserve on Swarthmore’s campus, Ben stopped at an overlook, got down on one knee, and popped the question. Lizzy said YES and is honored to wear Grandma Fran Nye’s ring.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Amy Boyd</h2>
              <p>Well, you can probably guess a bit about her childhood. She was always the gregarious, adventurous one. While Ben spent his time daydreaming, Amy was off making friends and finding new experiences. Never one to conform to what everyone else was doing, Amy went off to Evergreen College in Washington state where she studied ecology, botany, and biology.</p>
              <p>She found herself spending summers doing research on the north slope of Alaska while battling ravenous flocks of mosquitos, and spending her free time exploring Alaska's riverways.</p>
              <p>She managed to find a partner who shared her love of boating and exploration, and as a bonus they fell madly in love. Amy married her husband in 2013, and just welcomed her second child in to the world in January. Don't think for a second that she's slowed down - we're pretty sure her kids are going to be part river otter.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Zoe Dohnal</h2>
              <p>Although it was a tough decision, Lizzy choose Zoe to be her Twin of Honor. They became womb mates in 1986 and lived together for the next 22 years. They grew up trying to compliment one another. Lizzy was considered the “nerdy” one and Zoe was the “fun” one. They swapped places in class, tricked teachers and boyfriends, and conveniently shared a wardrobe. It has always been nice to have a best friend and a sister all in one.</p>
 
              <p>After Lizzy went to graduate school, Zoe began to travel the world. She worked for Crystal Cruises and Adventures by Disney, which allowed her to visit all 7 continents and over 125 countries. After meeting her husband, Zoe planted her roots in Telluride, CO and has been blooming into a successful business woman, friend, and mother.</p>
               
              <p>Although Lizzy and Zoe now live 2,000 miles apart, they still talk every day and support each other through all of life’s adventures. Lizzy is grateful to have Zoe stand by her side on her wedding day.</p>

            <p>Mount Cardigan rises up out of the Shem Valley as a beacon for outdoor lovers. Hikers are drawn to its bare summit not only for views but also for the quiet forests that line its approach. Look for salamanders, mushrooms, and blueberries along the way. Waterfalls, a small pond for swimming, and a nature trail await.</p>

            <p>Next to Mount Cardigan State Forest, Cardigan Lodge is located on a 1,200-acre reservation owned by AMC and features a peaceful, roads-end location. Explore 50 miles of trails, or simply relax on our deck or by the fireplace.</p>

            <p>Due to the limitations of the area, all of the available guest lodging has already been booked. Please let us know what your preferences are in the RSVP, and we will do our best to match you up with a room that will best suit your needs.</p>
            <div class="text-center"><h3>Cardigan Lodge</h3></div>
            <p>For those so inclined the top two floors of the lodge are 15 bunk rooms that each sleep 4-6 people, with four large multi-person bathrooms complete with showers. In addition to the bunk rooms, there are several campgrounds surrounding the lodge.</p>

            <div class="text-center"><h3>Local B&amp;Bs</h3></div>
            <p>For those who'd prefer a more removed respite, there are three nearby B&amp;Bs: <a href="http://www.thewhipplehouse.com/" style="color: #F9DA78;">The Whipple House</a>, <a href="http://www.pleasantviewbandb.net/" style="color: #F9DA78;">The Pleasant View</a>, and <a href="https://www.meadowwind.com/about-us/" style="color: #F9DA78;">The Meadow Wind</a>. They are each ~20 minutes driving from the lodge where all of the ceremonies and festivities will be taking place.
            <p>We will provide a shuttle for guests in the B&amp;Bs to get to and from the ceremony/reception.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Travel</h2>

            <p>All festivities for the weekend will take place on location at Cardigan Lodge. Although making it to the lodge takes some effort, once you arrive you're free to put your feet up (or boots on the trail) and enjoy the area over the course of the event.</p>
            <div class="text-center"><h3>Getting There</h3></div>
            <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/AMC+Cardigan+Lodge/@43.7196366,-72.0420081,10z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4cb3562e195bcb47:0x20def3359150bd6!8m2!3d43.6497852!4d-71.8778923" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Cardigan Lodge</a> is located an hour drive from either <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hdkQTfFjxVv" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Lebanon Municipal Airport</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/jx5QoRaxNuR2" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Manchester-Boston Regional Airport</a>. Alternatively, the main <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NaCzb7EtFVC2" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Boston airport</a> is still only a two hour drive.</p>
            <p>We are currently considering creating a schedule so that interested parties can coordinate to share a car rental if interested. Details forthcoming!</p>
            <div class="text-center"><h3>Things To Do</h3></div>
            <p>Hiking around the lodge. Cardigan Lodge's primary purpose is to serve as an access point to an awesome network of trails. Bring some hiking shoes and don't miss out!</p>
            <p><img src="img/tmp/hiking.png" alt="" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></p>
            <p>Sport climbing at <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105867829/rumney" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Rumney Rocks</a>, one of New England's most popular sport climbing spots. The general store in Rumney also has awesome ice cream.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.funspotnh.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Largest Arcade in the World</a>. Who knows - it sounds wacky.</p>
            <p>Pop in to the neighboring town of Bristol, NH (home of the legendary Whipple House B&amp;B). There's a little <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/shacketts-brewing-company-bristol" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">brewery</a>, a <a href="http://www.newfoundlakevineyards.com/wine-list" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">vineyard</a>, and more.</p>
            <p>Pick fresh apples right off the branch just down the road at <a href="http://www.cardiganmtnorchard.com/our-apple-orchard/" target="_blank" style="color: #F9DA78;">Cardigan Mountain Orchard.</a>
